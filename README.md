# AgenticAIPortfolio

A comprehensive portfolio showcasing advanced Multi-Agent AI Systems built with the CrewAI, LangGraph and AutoGen frameworks. While I have experience with LangGraph and AutoGen, CrewAI's framework, in my opinion, offers superior flexibility and completeness for these implementations.

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates practical applications of Multi-Agent AI Systems in various domains. Each project showcases real-world automation possibilities using autonomous AI agents working in coordination. While these examples use CrewAI, the architectural patterns can be adapted to other frameworks like LangGraph or AutoGen.
